## Application Overview

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50% of pregnancies are unplanned. This statistic underscores the significant challenges many parents face in raising their children. These challenges are particularly pronounced for single, young, and underprivileged parents, who often lack the necessary resources, knowledge, and preparation to provide their children with the best possible upbringing. Even parents with the means to provide for their children may struggle to find the time to research parenting information and resources on their own, despite having adequate financial means.

In light of these challenges, Carve is an innovative mobile application that seeks to help parents tackle these issues by providing them with personalized content and resources on essential parenting skills. With Carve, parents can access this information in as little as 10 minutes per day, making it possible for even the busiest parents to stay informed and up-to-date on the latest parenting trends and practices.

Carve is designed to cater to all types of parents, including those who are underprivileged and often overlooked. By providing access to reliable information and communities both locally and globally, Carve seeks to accommodate diverse cultural and personal values, empowering parents to make informed decisions about their child-rearing practices.

On the technical front, Carve leverages the power of Flutter for its front-end development, enabling the app to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience. The back-end architecture of Carve is built using Cloud Firestore, a scalable NoSQL database that provides superior performance and reliability. Google Analytics is seamlessly integrated into the app's database, allowing for powerful tracking and user metrics. Additionally, Carve uses APIs and external libraries to enhance user experience, creating a cost-effective and powerful platform.
